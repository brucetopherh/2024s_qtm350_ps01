# Pet Adoption Recommendation System
The purpose of this project is to connect potential pet owners with their prospective pets. Through a recommendation system, owners will be recommended potential pets based on their initial filters, which will update automatically as they go through their recommendations. The recommendation system will learn an owner's preferences.
The recommendation system will continuously refine its suggestions based on user interactions to enhance the matching process between potential pet owners and their ideal companions.
